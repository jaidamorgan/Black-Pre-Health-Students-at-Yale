       <div class="profile"><p><strong>Anjelica Gonzalez, Biomedical Engineering</strong></p>
       <img src="anjelicag.png" width="200" height="165" align="left"/>
       <p>Anjelica has a dedicated interest in training the next generation of scientists to think interdisciplinary and approach problems form a scientifically global perspective. With a multi-disciplinary approach, the Gonzalez lab combines organic chemistry, molecular biology, mathematics, computational modeling and image analysis to develop and use biomedically engineering scaffolds to dissect the chemo-mechanics of immunological processes. This work has special significance to an array of diseases and disorders, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and sepsis.</p>

Dr. Nunez-Smith’s research focuses on promoting health and healthcare equity for structurally marginalized populations with an emphasis on supporting healthcare workforce diversity and development, developing patient reported measurements of healthcare quality, and identifying regional strategies to reduce the global burden of non-communicable diseases. She is the principal investigator on several NIH and foundation-funded research projects, including an NIH-funded project to develop a tool to assess patient reported experiences of discrimination in healthcare. She has conducted an investigation of the promotion and retention of diversity in academic medical school faculty and has published numerous articles on the experiences of minority students and faculty. Funded by NIH/NIMHD, she established the Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN), a research collaborative across four Eastern Caribbean islands, supporting several chronic disease research projects and enhancing health outcomes research and leadership capacity in the region. She recently received NIH/NHLBI funding to build upon this work by recruiting children into an expanded intergenerational ECHORN cohort, inclusive of a biorepository. She is also PI on one of five NIH/NIMHD-funded Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers on Health Disparities focused on Precision Medicine which leverages the ECHORN infrastructure to conduct collaborative research on hypertension and diabetes. Dr. Nunez-Smith is board certified in internal medicine, having completed residency training at Harvard University’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and fellowship at the Yale Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program, where she also received a Masters in Health Sciences.</p>
